Bactra was no ordinary camel; he bore two mighty humps upon his back, a symbol of his great energy reserves, firmness and symmetry. Bactra roamed the vastness as the herd leader, with metaphysical guidance from a wise Humpkeeper.

As he gathered his collection the One would reason with the head Camels like Bactra, these special sci-future creatures knew the deepest secrets of the cosmos, and they would channel their gems of insightâ€¦ from time to time.
